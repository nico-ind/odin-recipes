    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Thin, delicate and crispy, these Florentines, also called lace cookies sometimes, are the perfect sweet treat for a fancy afternoon tea and will make a lovely gift for the holidays.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup sultanas</li>
        <li>2 cups cornflakes</li>
        <li>100g slivered almonds</li>
        <li>100g chopped Coles glace cherries</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mixed peel</li>
        <li>2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>250g dark chocolate, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 170Â°C. Line 2 large baking trays with non-stick baking paper.</li>
        <li>Combine the sultanas, cornflakes, almonds, glace cherries, mixed peel and sweetened condensed milk in a bowl. Place spoonfuls of the mixture on baking trays, leaving enough room between each for biscuits to spread. Bake for 10 minutes until light golden brown, then set aside on a wire rack to cool.</li>
        <li>Melt the dark chocolate in a bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Set aside to cool slightly then spread over the underside of the florentines. Use a fork to make wiggly lines in the chocolate, then place, chocolate-side up, on a wire rack until set.</li>
    </ol>
